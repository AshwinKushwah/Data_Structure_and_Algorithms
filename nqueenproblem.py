# Solving the N queen problem using backtraking
# What is the N Queen problem - The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed.
# What is backtracking - Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).
